## User guidence 
Codes are completed in R project. After cloning the repository, one can open the project with “Project.Rproj” file. The codes can be successfully run in the "main.R" file. One can obtain the results after a short time running. In "main.R", the highest retained frequency N is set to 10 considering the computational time. However, N = 10 gives relatively poor results as shown in the "results" folder. I also upload the case when N = 20, which shows a much better performance.
